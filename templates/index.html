                buildings collectively, for the purpose of sheltering people — the planning or provision delivered by an
                authority, with related meanings.Ensuring that members of society have a home in which to live,
                whether this is a house, or some other kind of dwelling, lodging, or shelter, is a social issue.

                Affordable housing is housing which is deemed affordable to those with a median household income or
                below as rated by the national government or a local government by a recognized housing affordability
                index. Most of the literature on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist
                along a continuum – from emergency shelters, to transitional housing, to non-market rental (also known
                as social or subsidized housing), to formal and informal rental, indigenous housing, and ending with
                affordable home ownership.

                Housing is recognized as a social determinant of health. Lack of housing or poor-quality housing can
                negatively affect an individual's physical and mental health. Housing attributes that negatively affect
                physical health include dampness, mold, inadequate heating, and overcrowding. Mental health is also
                affected by inadequate heating, overcrowding, dampness, and mold, as well as lack of personal space.[4]
                Housing can affect the health of children through exposure to asthma triggers or lead, and through
                injuries due to structural deficiencies.

                A housing estate (or sometimes housing complex or housing development) is a group of homes and other
                buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country.
